description: Using Amazon DynamoDB for persistent conversation storage in the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System
---

DynamoDB storage provides a scalable and persistent solution for storing conversation history in the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System. This option is ideal for production environments where long-term data retention and high availability are crucial.

## Features

- Persistent storage across application restarts
- Scalable to handle large volumes of conversation data
- Integrated with AWS services for robust security and management

## When to Use DynamoDB Storage

- In production environments
- When long-term persistence of conversation history is required
- For applications that need to scale horizontally

## Implementation

To use DynamoDB storage in your Multi-Agent Orchestrator:

1. Set up a DynamoDB table with the following schema:
   - Partition Key: `PK` (String)
   - Sort Key: `SK` (String)

2. Use the DynamoDbStorage when creating your orchestrator:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


<Tabs syncKey="runtime">
  <TabItem label="Typescript"  icon="seti:typescript" color="blue" >

```typescript
import { DynamoDbStorage, MultiAgentOrchestrator } from 'multi-agent-orchestrator';

const tableName = 'YourDynamoDBTableName';
const region = 'your-aws-region';
const dynamoDbStorage = new DynamoDbStorage(tableName, region);

const orchestrator = new MultiAgentOrchestrator({
   storage: dynamoDbStorage
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
    // TODO: Add python code here
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Configuration

Ensure your AWS credentials are properly set up and that your application has the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table.

## Considerations

- Requires AWS account and proper IAM permissions
- May incur costs based on usage and data storage
- Read and write operations may have higher latency compared to in-memory storage

## Best Practices

- Use DynamoDB storage for production deployments
- Implement proper error handling for network-related issues
- Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data to optimize performance
- Regularly backup your DynamoDB table to prevent data loss

DynamoDB storage offers a robust and scalable solution for managing conversation history in production environments. It ensures data persistence and allows your Multi-Agent Orchestrator System to handle large-scale deployments with reliable data storage and retrieval capabilities.
