In the Multi-Agent Orchestrator, an agent is a fundamental building block designed to process user requests and generate a response. The `Agent` abstract class serves as the foundation for all specific agent implementations, providing a common structure and interface.

## Agent selection process

The Multi-Agent Orchestrator uses a [Classifier](/multi-agent-orchestrator/classifiers/overview), typically an LLM, to select the most appropriate agent for each user request.

At the heart of this process are the **agent descriptions**.
These descriptions are critical and should be as detailed and comprehensive as possible.

A well-crafted agent description:

- Clearly outlines the agent's capabilities and expertise
- Provides specific examples of tasks it can handle
- Distinguishes it from other agents in the system

The more detailed and precise these descriptions are, the more accurately the Classifier can route requests to the right agent. This is especially important in complex systems with multiple specialized agents.

For a more detailed explanation of the agent selection process, please refer to the [How it works section](/multi-agent-orchestrator/general/how-it-works) section in our documentation.

To optimize agent selection:
- Invest time in crafting thorough, specific agent descriptions
- Regularly review and refine these descriptions
- Use the framework's [agent overlap analysis](/multi-agent-orchestrator/advanced-features/agent-overlap) to ensure clear differentiation between agents

By prioritizing detailed agent descriptions and fine-tuning the selection process, you can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of your Multi-Agent Orchestrator implementation.


## The Agent Abstract Class

The `Agent` class is an abstract base class that defines the essential properties and methods that all agents in the system must have. It's designed to be flexible, allowing for a wide range of implementations from simple API callers to complex LLM-powered conversational agents.

### Key Properties

- `name`: A string representing the name of the agent.
- `id`: A unique identifier for the agent, automatically generated from the name.
- `description`: A string describing the agent's capabilities and expertise.

### Abstract Method: processRequest

The core functionality of any agent is encapsulated in the `processRequest` method. This method must be implemented by all concrete agent classes:


import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


<Tabs syncKey="runtime">
  <TabItem label="Typescript"  icon="seti:typescript" color="blue" >

```typescript
abstract processRequest(
  inputText: string,
  userId: string,
  sessionId: string,
  chatHistory: Message[],
  additionalParams?: Record<string, any>
): Promise<Message | AsyncIterable<any>>;
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
    // TODO: Add python code here
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>




- `inputText`: The user's input or query.
- `userId`: A unique identifier for the user.
- `sessionId`: An identifier for the current conversation session.
- `chatHistory`: An array of previous messages in the conversation.
- `additionalParams`: Optional parameters for additional context or configuration. This is a powerful feature that allows for dynamic customization of agent behavior
  - It's an optional object of key-value pairs that can be passed when calling `routeRequest` on the orchestrator.
  - These parameters are then forwarded to the appropriate agent's `processRequest` method.
  - Custom agents can use these parameters to adjust their behavior or provide additional context for processing the request.


The method returns either a `Promise<Message>` for single responses or `Promise<AsyncIterable<any>>` for streaming responses.



Example usage:

<Tabs syncKey="runtime">
  <TabItem label="Typescript"  icon="seti:typescript" color="blue" >

```typescript
// When calling routeRequest
const response = await orchestrator.routeRequest(
  userInput,
  userId,
  sessionId,
  { location: "New York", units: "metric" }
);

// In a custom agent's processRequest method
class WeatherAgent extends Agent {
  async processRequest(
    inputText: string,
    userId: string,
    sessionId: string,
    chatHistory: Message[],
    additionalParams?: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<Message> {
    const location = additionalParams?.location || "default location";
    const units = additionalParams?.units || "metric";
    // Use location and units to fetch weather data
    // ...
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">

```python
// TODO: Add python code here
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
