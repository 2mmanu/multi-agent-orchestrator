description: Understanding and using the Agent Overlap Analysis feature in the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System
---

## Overview

Agent Overlap Analysis is an advanced feature of the Multi-Agent Orchestrator System that helps you optimize your agent configurations. This tool analyzes the descriptions of your agents to identify similarities, potential conflicts, and the uniqueness of each agent's role within the system.

## Why Use Agent Overlap Analysis?

1. **Optimize Agent Configurations**: Ensure each agent has a distinct purpose and minimize redundancy in your multi-agent setup.
2. **Identify Potential Conflicts**: Discover areas where agents might have overlapping responsibilities, which could lead to confusion or inconsistent responses.
3. **Enhance System Efficiency**: By refining agent roles based on the analysis, you can create a more efficient and effective multi-agent system.
4. **Improve User Experience**: Clear agent distinctions lead to more accurate query routing and better responses for end-users.

## How It Works

The Agent Overlap Analysis uses natural language processing techniques to compare agent descriptions:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Agent descriptions are tokenized and stopwords are removed.
2. **TF-IDF Calculation**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is computed for each agent's description.
3. **Pairwise Comparison**: Each agent's description is compared with every other agent's description using cosine similarity of their TF-IDF vectors.
4. **Uniqueness Scoring**: A uniqueness score is calculated for each agent based on its average dissimilarity from all other agents.

## Using Agent Overlap Analysis

To use the Agent Overlap Analysis feature:

```typescript
import { AgentOverlapAnalyzer } from './agentOverlapAnalyzer';
import { MultiAgentOrchestrator } from './agentSystem';

// Assume you have already set up your orchestrator with agents
const orchestrator = new MultiAgentOrchestrator();
// ... add agents to the orchestrator ...

// Get all agents from the orchestrator
const agents = orchestrator.getAllAgents();

// Create an analyzer instance
const analyzer = new AgentOverlapAnalyzer(agents);

// Run the analysis
analyzer.analyzeOverlap();
```

This will output the analysis results to the console.

## Understanding the Results

The analysis provides two main types of results:

### 1. Pairwise Overlap Results

For each pair of agents, you'll see:
- **Overlap Percentage**: How similar their descriptions are (higher percentage means more overlap).
- **Potential Conflict**: Categorized as "High", "Medium", or "Low" based on the overlap percentage.

Example output:
```
finance - tech:
- Overlap Percentage - 15.23%
- Potential Conflict - Medium
```

### 2. Uniqueness Scores

For each agent, you'll see a uniqueness score indicating how distinct its role is within the system.

Example output:
```
Agent: finance, Uniqueness Score: 89.55%
```

## Interpreting and Acting on Results

- **High Overlap / Low Uniqueness**: Consider refining agent descriptions to create clearer distinctions between their roles.
- **Low Overlap / High Uniqueness**: This generally indicates well-differentiated agents, but ensure the agents still cover all necessary domains.
- **Medium Overlap**: Some overlap can be acceptable, especially for related domains. Use your judgment to decide if refinement is needed.

## Best Practices

1. **Run Analysis Regularly**: Perform this analysis whenever you add new agents or modify existing agent descriptions.
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Use the results to refine your agent descriptions, then re-run the analysis to see the impact of your changes.
3. **Balance Specificity and Coverage**: Aim for agent descriptions that are specific enough to be unique but broad enough to cover their intended domain.
4. **Consider Context**: Remember that some overlap might be necessary or beneficial, depending on your use case.

## Limitations

- The analysis is based solely on textual descriptions. It doesn't account for the actual functionality or implementation of the agents.
- Very short or overly generic descriptions may lead to less meaningful results.

By leveraging the Agent Overlap Analysis feature, you can continuously refine and optimize your multi-agent system, ensuring each agent has a clear, distinct purpose while collectively covering all necessary domains of expertise.
